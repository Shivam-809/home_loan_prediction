üè° Home Loan Prediction

This project aims to predict the approval status of home loan applications using machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing applicant data, the model determines the likelihood of loan approval, assisting financial institutions in making informed decisions.

- data/: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development processes.
- app.py: Flask web application for user interaction with the prediction model.
- best_model.pkl: Serialized version of the trained model for deployment.
- requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
- run_training.py: Script to initiate model training.
- train_model.py: Contains functions and classes related to model training and evaluation.
